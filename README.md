# Sleep as CPU Hacker

An addon for [Sleep as Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep) which adds an additional [CAPTCHA](https://docs.sleep.urbandroid.org/alarms/captcha.html) module which requires you to execute simple x86 assembly instructions in your head.

## Known issues

The addon is not detected by Sleep as Android on Android 11+. Are any custom addons working on Android 11+?!
